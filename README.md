# py_docker_stats_collector


This tool will collect stats similarly to cadvisor, but unlike cadvisor all stats and graphs will be stored locally so they can be used by any other applications or if you just want to leave it running in the background collecting data and come back a later time to check the results.


Once the first version is developed i will update this readme file with the usage instructions
