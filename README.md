# py_docker_stats_collector

project started on 21-09-2015

First working version expected release date: 27-09-2015


This tool will collect stats similarly to cadvisor, but unlike cadvisor all stats and graphs will be stored locally so they can be used by any other applications or if you just want to leave it running in the background collecting data and come back a later time to check the results.


Once the first version is developed I will update this readme file with the usage instructions


MORE INFO: With this tool you will be able to store and analyse cpu usage, individual core usage and ram_usage for now, the data will be presented to the user in 2 different ways, a text version not sure about which format yet, and a graphic version(graphs will be stored in some location passed in by the user). More info coming soon...
